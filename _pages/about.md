Hi my name is Katarina! I am a **PhD Student** at **University of Oxford** supervised by [Prof Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/) and [Dr İsmail Ceylan](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ismaililkan.ceylan/). My research focuses on flow-based generative models, particularly flow matching and diffusion, to capture the evolution of complex dynamical systems across space and time. I am particularly interested in AI4Science applications such as modelling cell trajectories and small molecule generation.

I previously completed a research internship at [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org) in Boston in [Barabasi Lab](https://barabasi.com/science), where I focused on leveraging LLMs to identify potential drug repurposing candidates and learn underlying disease mechanisms in gene networks.

I hold MEng in Engineering Science from University of Oxford, where I was a recipient of Simon and June Li full-ride Oxford scholarship awarded on the basis of outstanding academic merit. I completed my Master’s thesis at Oxford Man Institute of Quantitative Finance under supervision of [Prof Xiaowen Dong](https://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/) and [Dr Jan-Peter Calliess](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~jan/), where I was developing multi-period optimization algorithms for trading in the FX markets.

In summer 2020, I worked as an Investment Banking Summer Analyst at Goldman Sachs (London office). After graduating from University of Oxford in 2021, I worked as a Private Equity Analyst at The Carlyle Group (London office) where I was specializing in real estate acquisitions across the European markets.
